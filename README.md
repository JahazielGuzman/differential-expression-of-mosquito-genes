Differential Expression
=======================
These Python, R and BASH scripts have been used to process BAM files containing Aedes Aegypti reads aligned to a reference genome obtained from VectorBase.

These BAM files each contain a set of "reads" which are digitized DNA sequences output from a DNA sequencer. The sequences correspond to the set of mRNA molecules extracted from an organism under a particular experimental condition. The sequences in the BAM files have been mapped to an "reference genome" and thus contain the corresponding numeric positions to which they map in the reference.

The script copy_bam.sh moves the BAM files stored on the local computer to an external hard drive labeled JAXI.
